WaterWave
=========

##Simplicity

This is a very simple demo for drawing a water waving - like view for meeting the need.

This demo use a simple sine funtion to draw the view.

You can define any factor you want to use.

Just change the `_currentLinePointY` to change the vertical cooperation and the meter in sine to change the hertz.

You can do it very well I think.
